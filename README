Unix V7 ed, in more modern C
----------------------------

What it is
----------

This is ed derived from version 7 UNIX (see COPYING regarding the 
license), modernized to contemporary Gnu C and using Auto-tools, and
perhaps even improved.

This code is **AS-IS**.  I maintain it for my own education, not for
making it work well.  This is "ed".  I'm sure you won't have trouble
finding a more robust version.
